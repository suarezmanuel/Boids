Manuel's ~~Fully functional Boids~~ Game of throwing disks. <br> Pauses and resumes with flabbergasting splendeur and precision, by pressing either p or space. <br><br>

The disks have been engrained with a complex network of deep human emotions, slothness being the most prominent. <br>
Mixed together with a sprinkle of freewill, such that they opt not to move. <br>
Very human-like indeed. <br><br>

You can adjust the velocity vectors by holding a mouse key and pressing the other to stop, after clicking in order to add the "birds". <br>
SPOILER: They are supposed to be birds. you may need to squinch your eyes, tilt your head, and step back around 20 feet in order to see it. <br><br>
The deletion only takes place after resuming the game <br><br>
